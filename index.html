            <h4>Methodology</h4>
            </br>
            <p>The foundational data points of this interactive graphic come primarily from the Association for Children & Families’
                <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/afcarsreport27.pdf">2019 Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS)</a>, which is derived from case-level information on children in foster care and those who
                have been adopted with title IV-E agency involvement. The data reflects everything received within the period from September 30, 2019 to June 23, 2020. </p>
            </br>
            <p>The total number of data points is taken from the data set of Children Exiting Care, more specifically for the reason of emancipation. This refers to those who age out of the system between the ages of 18 to 21 as well as those minors who
                complete the emancipation process. The gender breakdown was taken from the overall number and reflected in the “Gender” group as well as within the “Outcomes” group. The “Race” group breakdown was also taken from the Children Exiting Care
                data set. Though they are not specific to the emancipation discharge, they are assumed to be similar for the sake of brevity. </p>
            </br>
            <p>For homelessness, mental health, education, and health insurance outcomes, I used the
                <a href="https://caseyfamilypro-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/media/AlumniStudies_NW_Report_FactSheet.pdf">Casey Family Program’s</a> analysis of the data from the Northwest Foster Care Alumni Study. The <a href="http://fosteringsuccessmichigan.com/uploads/misc/NW_Foster_Care_Alumni_Study.pdf">Northwest Foster Care Alumni Study (NW
                Alumni Study)</a> examined outcomes for 659 alumni who were placed in family foster care as children. These alumni were all adults age 20 to 33 who had been placed in family foster care between 1988 and 1998. Within th e12 months prior
                to being interviewed one or more mental health disorders, the most prevalent being post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder. Former foster youth do complete high school education at similar rates as the general population,
                but they use the GED six times higher. The data point above was taken from the percentage of completion of high school (diploma or GED).</p>
            </br>
            <p>For substance dependence, I used the <a href="https://nfyi.org/51-useful-aging-out-of-foster-care-statistics-social-race-media/">National Foster Youth Institute’s</a> statistics on aging out of foster care. For pregnancy, I used an academic
                article from Children and Youth Services Review: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0190740910001623?via%3Dihub">The risk of teenage pregnancy among transitioning
                foster youth: Implications for extending state care beyond age 18</a>. And finally, for Criminal Justice, I used a statistic from <a href="http://www.aecf.org/m/resourcedoc/aecf-JimCaseyInitiativeToolkit.pdf">Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative</a>.
